## about

hello, GitHub! :-)

I'm an artist / programmer. ***<sub>(very cool, I know)</sub>***

## projects

at the moment of writing this, I'm working on:

| status | name | summary |
| :---   | :--- | :---    |
| active | [sandeightwitch.github.io](https://github.com/sandeightwitch/sandeightwitch.github.io) | my personal website that will include my future projects, collaborations, blogs, and so much more. |

## FAQ

> what does the, "\*poof\* just like magic" mean?

> what's my goal here on GitHub?

well... I'm not quite sure, but definitely something ambitious!

> and finally... do I have a cat(s)??? 🙀

yes. I have two!
